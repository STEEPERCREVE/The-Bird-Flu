Coding final, not so much a showcase of skill, but more a personal learning experience intended to learn tkinter, images, and more about python in general.


**Warning: There is no real way to close the program, it must be closed in task manager.** (also a small amount of lag was produced when many birds were flying and hitting the edges at once, or when their randomness caused extremely fast bouncing and queued tons of sfx to play)

The birdflu is a file that just puts bird on your screen, between one and five, that bounce around randomly and cannot be interacted with.
They are loud, and there is about a 1 in 1000 chance that the sound they will produce is a "tweet tweet" voiced by someone on freesound.
All images come from google and remove.bg and all sounds are from [https://freesound.com](freesound).

Made in my freetime for a friend who likes birds (and my coding final), this is my first real github project and is likely really poorly optimized. 

Here is a photo:

And a short clip:

Unfortunately, I was far too lazy to make it wrap across screens, so the birds are locked in a little digital cage.
_Also, this isnt well made (if it wasnt obvious)._
**Enjoy!**
